# 42sh
Unix shell
*42sh* is the **last project** on the Unix path at [42](https://www.42.fr/). The goal is to write a **fully-fledged shell**, allowing the user to interact with our shell and execute commands. Please see the PDF file for more information.

This program was not programmed to be portable. Indeed, the code was written to be [norme compliant](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/960/norme.en.pdf)
This program will probably NOT compile on any other machine than macOS.
